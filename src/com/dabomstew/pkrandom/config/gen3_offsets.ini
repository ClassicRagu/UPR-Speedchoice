TMTextSpdc[]=[28,0x16F353,Those miserable ROCKETS!\pLook what they’ve done to my house!\pThey stole a TM for teaching POKéMON how to [move]!\pThat cost me a bundle, it did!]

MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[3,0x1C9D14,Which POKéMON wants to learn how to [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[4,0x1C971B,You should be proud of yourself, having battled your way through VICTORY ROAD so courageously.\pIn recognition of your feat, I’ll teach you [move].\pWould you like me to teach that technique?]

MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[6,0x1C9B4E,Which POKéMON wants to learn [move]?]

MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[8,0x1C9C4E,Tch-tch-tch! That’s the sound of a metronome.\pIt inspired me to start teaching [move] to interested trainers.]

MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[10,0x1C99AE,Which POKéMON wants to learn [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[11,0x1C9783,Eeek! No! Stop! Help!\pOh, you’re not with TEAM ROCKET. I’m sorry, I thought…\pWill you forgive me if I teach you the [move] technique?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[11,0x1C97A6,Which POKéMON should I teach [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[11,0x1C97D6,[move] is a useful move, but it might not work on some POKéMON.]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[11,0x1C97CC,Oh… But [move] is convenient…]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[12,0x1C9853,Can you imagine? If this volcano were to erupt?\pThe explosion would be the end of us. How terrifying is that?\pWhile we’re terrified, would you like me to teach [move]?]

MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[12,0x1C98A6,Using [move] while on this volcano…\pWhat a terrifying thrill!]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[13,0x1C97EB,When you’re up on a rocky mountain like this, rockslides are a threat.\pCan you imagine? Boulders tumbling down on you?\pThat’d be, like, waaaaaaaaaaah! Total terror!\pYou don’t seem to be scared. Want to try using [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[13,0x1C980E,Which POKéMON should I teach [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[14,0x1C9A5B,Aww, I wish I was a KANGASKHAN baby.\pI’d love to be a substitute for the baby…\pAnd snuggle in the mother KANGASKHAN’s belly pouch.\pBut only POKéMON can do that…\pOn an unrelated note, want me to teach [move] to one of your POKéMON?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[14,0x1C9A7E,Which POKéMON wants to learn [move]?]
